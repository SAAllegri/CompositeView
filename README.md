# Combined Scores Visualizer

This software is designed to visualize data, specifically combined scores data, utilizing graph theory and network analysis concepts. It was initially an offshoot of SemNet [cite SemNet], where interpreting results (especially multi-target results) all but require such a tool. Given the nature of the SemNet results data, the visualizer was generalized to allow similar data sets to be used.

### Useful Definitions
* **Combined score**: an aggregated score across multiple performance metrics. Take the Human Development Index (HDI) as an example. The HDI value assigned to a country is the geometric mean of three performance metrics: life expectancy, expected years of schooling/mean years of schooling, and gross national income per captia, all normalized between 0 and 1. The HDI value in this case is the combined score of the three performance metrics mentioned. This combined score is then used to rank countries based on how "developed" they are.
* **Source node**: A node that has an in-degree of zero. This term is borrowed from graph theory, and it is used to model the individual datapoints that are being visualized. Each source node represents a different entity, in this case a specific datapoint. Continuing the HDI example, both Norway and Malawi, countries ranked based on their respective HDI, would each be represente in the visualizer as a node. This node is defined as the source node.

* **Target node**: A node that has an out-degree of zero. This is another term borrowed from graph theory, and it is used to model the metrics being combined to form the combined score. In the HDI example, the target nodes would be life expectancy, expected years of schooling/mean years of schooling, and gross national income per captia respectively. In this example, each source node, representing each country, is assigned a value in respect to each target node. Not EVERY source node must be ranked in respect to EVERY target node.

* **Edge value**: The value assigned to each connection between a source and target node. In the HDI example, Norway is assigned a value in respect to all three target nodes. This relationship could be described as "Norway scores X in respect to life expectancy" or "Malawi scores Y in respect to gross national income per capita. In these example relationships, the X and Y values represent the edge values. These edge values are combined, per source node, to generate a combined score (which is then assigned to that source node).

* **Node Type**: A discrete categorization that can be assigned to both source and target nodes. For example, the source node "Norway" in the HDI example might be assigned the type "Europe" to indicate what continent the country resides. The target node "life expectancy" might be assigned the type "target_node" to indicate that it's a target.

### Formatting the Data
The following table shows the data format required for the Visualizer. The three rows in the table correspond to the three source-target relationships shared by the source node "Sweden." More specifically, the three relationships are Sweden-income_index, Sweden-life_expectancy_index, and Sweden-education_index, where each corresponding value is indicated in the edge_value column.
|source_id|source_name|source_type|target_id|target_name|target_id|edge_value|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|Sweden|Sweden|very_high_development|income_index|income_index|target_node|0.952|
|Sweden|Sweden|very_high_development|life_expectancy_index|life_expectancy_index|target_node|0.966|
|Sweden|Sweden|very_high_development|education_index|education_index|target_node|0.917|
* **source_id**: Unique source node identifier. A source node could potentially share a source_name value with another node, but it will never share the source_id value. This is the value that the NetworkX graph object utilizes when buiding/simulating the graph
* **source_name**: The name associated with a particular source node. As mentioned above, the source_name value could be shared between source nodes, but the source_id value should never be shared. 
* **source_type**: The "category" for the associated source node. In the example above, the category for source_id "Sweden" is very_high_development.
* **target_id**: Unique target node identifier. Similar to source_id.
* **target_name**: The name associated with a particular target node. Similar to source_name.
* **target_type**: The "category" for the associated target node. Similar to source_type.
* **edge_value**: The determined value or "metric" between the source node and target node. In the above table, each row indicates a unique connection between the row's source and target nodes. That connection is quantified by the edge_value value. As a rule of thumb, this value should share similar units/scale to other edge values (to keep certain sliders within the visualizer relevant).

As a brief aside, the table above shows all three HDI metrics for Sweden, modeled as a network. When calculating HDI, the geometric mean of all three edge values determines the actual HDI score, which is assigned to the country (which allows the country to be ranked in relation to other countries). The node size is determined by this combined value, which the visualizer will automatically calculate. The method for combining these scores can be directly modified within the `generate_graph` class, specifically the `_combine_values()` method.

### Filters/Interactive Elements
The Visualizer filters/interactive elements can be accessed through the "Expand Settings" button. This will activate a dropdown with the following  categories:
* **Graph Sliders**: Sliding elements that allow the user to set precise value bounds.
    * **Combined Value**: Set the combined value bound.
    * **Edge Value**: Set the edge value bound.
    * **Max Node Count**: Set the maximum number of source nodes that are rendered, sorted by combined value.
* **Node Filtering**:
    * **Select Target Node Name(s)**: Dropdown element that allows specific target nodes to be selected.
    * **Select Source Node Name(s)**: Dropdown element that allows specific source nodes to be selected.
    * **Select Type(s)**: Dropdown element that allows for specific node types to be selected. Note: In order for the target nodes to show up, their node type must also be selected in conjunction with any source node types.
* **Graph Manipulation**:
    * **Target Spread**: Slider element that adjusts the target node spread. This value is used in the NetworkX spring_layout method, which positions nodes using the Fruchterman-Reingold (FR) force-directed algorithm, by adjusting the optimal distance between nodes (k-value). The target spread affects the k-value for the first simulation, where the target nodes are placed and fixed (more on that later). 
    * **Source Spread**: Another sliding element. Source spread is essentially the same concept as the target spread, however the k-value being adjusted happens to be in the second simulation, where the source nodes fill in the space between targets. Adjusting this value will result in more densly packed clusters of nodes that are harder to individually identify but easier to associate with specific target nodes.
    * **Node Size**: Sliding element that adjusts node size. The text associated with the node also scales. 
    * **Edge Size**: Sliding element that adjusts ede size. Like node size, the text associated with the edge also scales. 
    * **Simulation Iterations**: The number of iterations that the FR algorithm is run during the second simulation. This slider is a BIG performance contributer. If there are many thousands of data points being simulated, setting this to three or two, maybe even one or zero, would help performance significantly. Trimming the graph and setting value bounds also helps performance, allowing for more simulation iterations to be run. 
    * **Simulate**: Button element that re-simulates the graph based on the value set by Simulation Iterations (see details below).
* **Color Editing**:
    * **Type Gradient**: Two color selection elements that allow for the graph nodes to adopt a color gradient, based on the Colour package method range_to(). Generally, for this to work properly, colors should be adjacent.
    * **Selected Source Node Type Color**: A single color selection element that changes a selected node's type color. For example, if source_node_1 is of type type_1 and colored green, selecting that node and picking a new color using this element will change all type_1 nodes to that chosen color.
    * **Source Node Color**: Change the color of all source nodes.
    * **Target Node Color**: Change the color of all target nodes.
    * **Randomize Color**: Randomized all node type colors.
* **Node Data**: Data associated with a selected node or group of selected nodes (selecting multiple nodes can be achieved by shift-dragging). The node data presented includes node_id, node_name, node_type, combined_value (if the selected node is a source node), source_or_targe_node, and edge values (the names + id on connected nodes, along with edge values).
* **Table Data**: Table of data based on trimming and filtering options applied to the graph. This table can be exported. 

Other interactive elements:
* **Reset Graph**: Resets the graph to its original state. If no data has been uploaded, then the graph will revert to the initial load state. If data has been uploaded, the graph will revert to the state where the uploaded data was first initialized.
* **Upload Data**: Where new data can be uploaded to the visualizer.
    * VERY IMPORTANT: The upload must follow the data format as described above and be a .csv file.
* **Download Image**: Downloads an image of the graph.

### Miscellaneous
* Performance: The simulation iterations sliding element is your best friend. Use it to increase performance (at the cost of a potentially less interpretable graph).
* Simulation details.
    * Force-directed graph drawing algorithms, including the one used in this visualizer, are a class of algorithms with the purpose of reducing edge overlap and generating equal length edges. The algorithm used in the visualizer is one of these force-directed graph drawing algorithms, specifically the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm (NetworkX spring_layout documentation: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.layout.spring_layout.html).
    * **The problem**: Often, using algorithms such as FR isn't enough. In the case of the Visualizer, what would often happen (without any tampering) is that nodes would often get "stuck" and fail to reach their (often obvious) optimal positions.
    * **The solution**: Given the structure of the data, generally there will be few highly connected targets and many slightly connected sources. These source nodes will cluster together, given that large number of them are often connected to the same set of target nodes. Given this circumstance, a method has been devised to initialize the nodes to prevent this "sticking" behavior. 
        * **Simulation 1**: The first step is simulating all of the target nodes WITHOUT the source nodes. The FR algorithm is used, and targets have shared edges IF they share a common source node. The more source nodes shared between sets of targets, the lower the edge weights between these targets (edge weight increases the "spring" force of the edges in the FR algorithm). By setting shared source nodes to be inversely proportional to edge weight, more "room" is allowed between targets that have many shared connected source nodes.
        * **Simulation 2**: Once the FR algorithm is run given the setup stated above, the source nodes are "filled in." Each group of source nodes that share common targets are placed at the centroid of this set of shared targets. Without additional modification, these source nodes would simply not move after being placed (they occupy the same position, therefore there is no "repelling" force), so each source nodes is distributed around the centroid based on a Gaussian distribution. This distribution allows the source nodes enough room to interact under the FR algorithm. This step is where setting simulation iterations to a lower value can vastly improve performance; force-directed algorithms can be computationally expensive and slow, so reducing simulation iterations generally improves performance. 
            * As a final aside, each source-target edge is assigned a weight value based on the edge value associated with the two nodes. This weight will "pull" the source node harder in the direction of the target it is most highly connected to. 
* Shift-dragging allows multiple source/target nodes to be selected. If the algorithm mentioned above doesn't produce optimal spacing results, this is the next best bet... or just re-simulate the graph.
